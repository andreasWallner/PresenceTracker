Presence Tracker
================

A simple tool that I use at work to see when I arrived and left.
It logs start, logon, logoff, lock and unlock events into a file
and displays log entries for the last few days.

It is by no means finished (and might never be) but it works for me.

After start the tool is only visible in the taskbar, by double-clicking
the icon, the Window displaying the last entries will be shown.

The TODO.md list is not a list of features that will be implemented,
more a list of stuff to do if I have time and want to write some C#.
